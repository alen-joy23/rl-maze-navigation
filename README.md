# RL Maze Navigation ðŸš€

This project uses Reinforcement Learning to train a robot to solve mazes using a custom Gym environment and PyTorch.

## ðŸ”§ Structure

- `envs/` â€“ Custom Gym maze environment
- `models/` â€“ RL model (e.g., DQN or PPO)
- `train/` â€“ Training scripts
- `evaluate/` â€“ Scripts to run the trained model
- `assets/` â€“ Maze maps, training videos, logs

## âœ… Goals

- Build a maze-solving RL agent
- Use PyTorch or stable-baselines3
- Train and visualize the agent's performance
